/**
 * P4 S4 — the pure batch derivation. This is the heart of "调度器无自有持久状态" (plan §1).
 *
 * ## Why there is no second source of truth
 *
 * The scheduler owns NO mutable state. Every tick recomputes "the next dispatch set" purely from the
 * durable Run — `plan.shots` (anchors + video shots, partitioned by role) + `jobs[]` + the budget
 * `ledger` summary + the anchor checkpoint gate. A crash-restart re-runs THIS SAME function over the
 * reloaded Run and gets THE SAME answer, because:
 *
 *   - "has this unit been dispatched?" = does `jobs[]` contain a job for `(shotId, currentAttempt)`?
 *     The jobId is derived deterministically (`jobIdFor`, mirroring productionGenerationSubmission.ts),
 *     so the durable job list IS the ledger of what was submitted. We never keep a private set.
 *   - "how much have we spent?" = the budget summary (reserved + actual + unsettled). The ledger is an
 *     append-only replay — itself a single source of truth. Halt is judged against `authorized`.
 *   - "did the anchor pass?" = the anchor checkpoint gate's status, written into the Run (never the
 *     renderer store). Waiting → shots blocked; approved (or auto-released) → shots released.
 *
 * This mirrors the already-shipped `latestGenerationAttempt` pattern (derive attempt from jobs[], never
 * self-count), so the two layers agree by construction and recovery cannot double-submit or over-spend.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock read (the caller passes `now`), no provider call. The scheduler orchestrator
 * turns this plan into side effects (reserve + submit inside the Run lock); this function only decides.
